1. New endpoint to SL to get the PDF data.
2. "Middleware" endpoint `udi-user-invoice-file-client` to get the different states of download.
3. Handler in button to trigger api call + save pdf file to local
4. Snackbar message if download, or endpoint fails

PS...I am not too quite sure how all of this should be typed, as this SL endpoint returns PDF data, which is converted to "arraybuffer", so please double check if typing is correct and/or missing.
